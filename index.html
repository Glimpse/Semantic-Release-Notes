                        Semantic Release Notes (SRN) is a text-to-object-to-html conversion tool for application authors. SRN 
                        specifically aims to produce <em>semantic</em> <strong>release notes</strong> from a Markdown document. 
                        This allows authors to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text document, convert it to a structured data format
                        (typically JSON or XML) and from this format, convert it into any styled representation (typically html) or to consume the 
                        information programatically within 3rd party applications.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Thus, SRN is two things:
                        <ol>
                            <li>a plain text DSL (domain specific language)/syntax for writting release notes; and</li>
                            <li>a software tool that converts said syntax into JSON/XML and subsequently HTML.</li>
                        </ol>
                        For details pertaining to SRN formatting, see the <a href="#Syntax">Syntax</a> section or 
                        try it out, right now, using the <a href="#Editor">Live Editor</a> or by extending the provided <a href="#Examples"> 
                        Examples</a>.
                    </p>
            
                    <h3>Goals</h3> 
                    <p>
                        The overriding design goals for SRN's syntax is:
                        <ul>
                            <li>to make it as <strong>readable as possible</strong>,</li>
                            <li>to <strong>support various formats</strong> in which release notes are published (Example: <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/nuspec-reference">NuSpec XML</a>),</li>
                            <li>to make this document <strong>parsable by a standard Markdown parser</strong>, and</li>
                            <li>to <strong>extract semantic release information</strong> from the document for further processing.</li>
                        </ul> 
                        The idea is that a SRN document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, 
                        without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. This works well in a 
                        Release Notes scenario where plain text documents usually accompany the build. Additional, with the 
                        assumptions around the formatting of the release document, SRN can <strong>extract semantic meaning</strong> 
                        from the plain text provided (i.e. the bugs fixed, features, included, release summaries, etc).
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Once we have the type representations, we can then look at producing the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                if a user <strong>updates through multiple versions</strong> of your product, be able to easily <strong>generate 
                                a consolidated release note</strong> which highlights the most important changes,
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                the above would also be true if the <i>user</i> wanted to view the <strong>changes that occurred 
                                between take 2 different releases</strong> - in effect producing a "diff" at the release notes level
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                be able to <strong>change the rendered display of the release notes</strong>, without changing the format of the 
                                original source
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why</h3>
                    <p>
                        With the way that we currently approach producing release notes, we lose any ability to "process" the data.
                        If we change this and produce something that can be, a variety of different possibilities can be realized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, most projects use either the following approaches:
                        <ol>
                            <li>a single document which lists every release, with the details of each release, or</li>
                            <li>a document which only shows the details or the latest release, or</li>
                            <li>a generated document which only shows the details of every release between what they had installed an how have.</li>
                        </ol>
                        These are mostly problematic as they aren't able to isolate which details the user should know about and in
                        most cases, drowns the user in more information than they can/want to take in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What we should be aiming for, is to help the users find what is the most important information 
                        they should know about. If we do this, users are more likely to find the information we as 
                        developers want them to know about and be educated as to what items in the release they may care about
                    </p>

                    <h3>Influences</h3> 
                    <p>
                        The establishment of the overall syntax and simplicity of the SRN syntax is based on <strong>Markdown</strong>.
                        As stated, a document based on SRN's syntax should be able to be parsed by a standard Markdown parser. 
                        This means that besides making the document human readable, it means that systems that aren't SRN 
                        aware but are Markdown aware, can still parse the documents.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        The idea of being able to extract semantic meaning from the release notes, isn't established here, rather 
                        influences where drawn from the semantic syntax of <strong>Todo.txt</strong> files. Documents that 
                        follow the conventions of the Todo.txt "standard" are able to extract typed information within the 
                        TODO domain from the document. The origins on the standard are similar to those of Markdown (a need 
                        for human readability), but also a need to be able to define tasks, which are complete, what priority 
                        a given task has, etc.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The axes of Semantic Release Notes </h3> 
                    <p>
                        Using the SRN syntax, you can create a list that can be broken along various key axes.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Summary</strong>:
                                At its most basic level, SRN should be able to take a paragraph and interpret that as the summary 
                                of a given release. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Item</strong>:
                                A release note should be able to show which "items" are included in a given release. Items typically include 
                                features, bug fixes, or improvements. This is indicated via 
                                a standard Markdown <em>ordered</em> or <em>unorderded</em> list. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Section</strong>:
                                Lets the author group items which represent logical sections within the application. 
                                These can be arbitrary in nature and specific to the release notes which application is for.
                                This is indicated via a standard Markdown <em>header</em>. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Priority</strong>:
                                The release note should be able to let you define the importance feature or item that has been 
                                defined. This is indicated via a standard Markdown <em>ordered list</em>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Category</strong>:
                                Additionally the release note should be able to indicate what category an item is. For instance, 
                                "+New", "+Change", "+Bug-Fix", +Developer". This is indicated via a single word, or - (dash) delimited phrase, that has a "+" prefix. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Release</strong>:
                                As SRN allows for many releases to be defined within the one block of text, the system needs 
                                to provide a means by which an individual release can be identified.
                                This is indicated via a standard Markdown <em>header</em>. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p> 
                
                    <h3>Summaries</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is useful to be able to provide summaries various parts of the release. Sections and Releases allow 
                        for multi-line multi-paragraph summaries, whilst the summary for an Item is more restrictive, only allowing a 
                        single paragraph descriptions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In each content block, a subset of Markdown is supported -  _italic_, **bold**, `code` and [link](uri).
                    </p>
                    <div class="container">
                        <strong>Examples:</strong>
                        <pre class="code">This is a _project_ summary with two paragraphs.

                    <h3>Items</h3>
                    <p>
                        When trying to extract individual items that make up a release, standard lists (ordered or unordered) are used. These 
                        lists indicate the items what are a part of the Section or Release they are a part of.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the syntax is a subset of Markdown the same list types are supported.   
                    </p>
                    <div class="container">
                        <strong>Examples:</strong>
                        <pre class="code"> - This is the _first_ *list* item.
 - This is the **second** __list__ item.
 - This is the `third` list item.
 - This is the [forth](?) list item.</pre>
                        <div class="result"></div>

                        When trying to extract individual items that make up a release, standard lists (ordered or unordered) are used. These 
                        lists indicate the items what are a part of the Section or Release they are a part of. These are usually used in larger 
                        applications when it's important to isolate out different sections of the application.

                    <p>
                        Sections are expressed through the use of headings. Also sections can have their own "Summaries" and "Items".

                    <h3>Priority</h3>
                    <p>
                        When defining items, the priority of the fix can be expressed via a standard ordered list. Normally we expect 
                        ordered lists index to increment sequentially upwards. For our purposes, since the index represents the the 
                        priority the values are always going to be 1, 2 or 3 - High, Normal and Minor. This means that when using 
                        priorities an index value is likely to be replicated. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the syntax is a subset of Markdown the same ordered list types is supported. Note, the 
                        index order isn't important.

 1. This is a High priority list item. 
 2. This is a Normal priority list item. 
 1. This is a High priority list item. 
 2. This is a Normal priority list item.
 3. This is a Minor priority list item.

                    <h3>Category</h3>
                    <p>
                        When creating creating items it's useful to be able to assign a Category to an item. Conventional Categories may be established 
                        are with special meaning. Examples may include: New, Fix, Changed and Developer (where Developer describes a change that 
                        developers would be interested over users).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Markdown doesn't have an exact way of expressing this requirement, hence we use the following notation: "+New" or "+Bug-Fix".

                    <h3>Release (Not Working)</h3>
                    <p>
                        In some cases we want to have the one document that describes many releases. In this case, the 
                        syntax simply allows you to define a heading which is the Version Number. If you use this feature 
                        in conjunction with sections, Section headers are also altered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the purposes of interpretation of the version number, it is assumed that you are using 
                        Semantic Visioning - <a href="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</a>. Normal Markdown headers 
                        are used to describe the version number for each release and the scope 
                        of reach release (which item, etc makes up the release).
