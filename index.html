                    <p>
                        Semantic Release Notes (SRN) is a text-to-object-to-html conversion tool for application authors. SRN 
                        specificly aims to produce <em>typed</em> <strong>Release Notes</strong> from a <strong>Markdown</strong> document. 
                        This allows authors to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text document, convert it to structured object 
                        (typically JSON or XML) and from this object, convert it into any styled format (typically html) or to consume the 
                        typed information within 3rd party applications.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        Thus, SRN is two things:
                        <ol>
                            <li>a plain text formatting syntax; and</li>
                            <li>a software tool that converts plain text formatting to JSON/XML and HTML.</li>
                        </ol>
                        See the <a href="#Syntax">Syntax</a> section for details pertaining to SRN fomatting syntax. You can 
                        also try it out, right now, using the online <a href="#Editor">Editor</a> or extending the provided 
                        examples.  
                    </p>
            
                    <h3>Goals</h3> 
                    <p>
                        The overriding design goals for SRN's formatting syntax is:
                        <ul>
                            <li>to make it as <strong>readable as possible</strong>,</li>
                            <li>to make this document <strong>parsable by a standard Markdown parser</strong>, and</li>
                            <li>to <strong>extract typed release information</strong> from the document.</li>
                        </ul> 
                        The idea is that a SRN-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, 
                        without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. This works well in a 
                        Release Notes senario where plan text documents usually accompany the build. Additional, with the 
                        assumtptions around the formating of the Release document, SRN can <strong>extract semantic meaning</strong> 
                        from the plain text provided (i.e. the bugs fixed, features, included, release summaries, etc).
                    </p>

                    <h3>Influences</h3> 
                    <p>
                        The estabilishment of the overall snytax and simplicity of the document is based on <strong>Markdown</strong>.
                        As stated, a document based on SRN's syntax should be able to be parsed by a standard Markdown parser. 
                        This means that besides making the document human readable, it means that systems that aren't SRN 
                        aware but are Markdown aware, can still parse the documents.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        The idea of being able to extract typed meaning from the document, isn't estabilished here, rather 
                        influcences where drawn from the typed format of <strong>TODO.txt</strong> files. Documents that 
                        follow the conventions of the TODO.txt "standard" are able to extract typed information within the 
                        TODO domain from the document. The origins on the stanrd are similar to those of Markdown (a need 
                        for human readability), but also a need to be able to define tasks, which are complete, what priority 
                        a given task has, etc.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The axes of an Semantic Release Notes </h3> 
                    <p>
                        Using the Markdown syntax in a SRN, you can create a list that's sliceable by various key axes.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Summary</strong>:
                                At its most basic level, SRN should be able to take a paragraph and interprete that as the summary 
                                of what the release is about. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Item</strong>:
                                A release note should be able to show which "items" are included in a given release. This is indicated via 
                                a standard Markdown <em>ordered</em> or <em>unorderded</em> list. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Section</strong>:
                                Lets the author group items which represent logical sections within the application. 
                                These can be abratary in nature and specifc to the release notes which application is for.
                                This is indicated via a standard Markdown <em>header</em>. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Priority</strong>:
                                The release note should be able to let you define the importance feature or item that has been 
                                defined. This is indicated via a standard Markdown <em>ordered list</em>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Category</strong>:
                                Additionally the release note should be able to indicate what category an item is. For instance, 
                                "+New", "+Change", "+Fix", +Developer". This is indicated via a single word at the end of the 
                                list item that has a "+" prefix. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Release</strong>:
                                As SRN allows for many releases to be defined within the one block of text, the system needs 
                                to provide a means by which an indovidual release can be identified.
                                This is indicated via a standard Markdown <em>header</em>. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Project</strong>:
                                As SRN allows for many projects with many releases to be defined within the one block of 
                                text, the system needs to provide a means by which an indovidual release can be identified.
                                This is indicated via a standard Markdown <em>header</em>. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Summaries</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is useful to be able to provide summaries various parts of the release. Sections, Releases and Projects allow 
                        for multi-line multi-paragraph summaries, whilst the summary for an Item is more restictive, only allowing a 
                        single paragraph descriptions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In each content block, a subset of Markdown is supported -  _italic_, **bold**, `code` and [link](uri).
                    </p>
                    <div class="container">
                        <strong>Examples:</strong>
                        <pre class="code">This is a _project_ summary with two paragraphs.

                    <h3>Items</h3>
                    <p>
                        When trying to extract indovidual items that make up a release, standard lists (ordered or unordered) are used. These 
                        lists indicate the items what are a part of the Section or Release they are a part of.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the syntax is a subset of Markdown the same list types are supported.   
                    </p>
                    <div class="container">
                        <strong>Examples:</strong>
                        <pre class="code"> - This is the _first_ *list* item.
 - This is the **second** __list__ item.
 - This is the `third` list item.

                    <p>
                        When trying to extract indovidual items that make up a release, standard lists (ordered or unordered) are used. These 
                        lists indicate the items what are a part of the Section or Release they are a part of. These are usually used in larger 
                        applications when it's important to issolate out different sections of the application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sections are expressed through the use of headings. Also sections can have their own "Summaries" and "Items".
                    </p>
                    <div class="container">
                        <strong>Examples:</strong>
                        <pre class="code"># Section

 - This is a Section scoped first list item.

                    <h3>Priority</h3>
                    <p>
                        When defining items, the priority of the fix can be expressed via a standard ordered list. Normally we expect 
                        ordered lists index to increment sequentially upwards. For our purposes, since the index represents teh the 
                        priority the values are always going to be 1, 2 or 3 - High, Normal and Minor. This means that when using 
                        priorities an index value is likely to be replicated. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the syntax is a subset of Markdown the same ordered list types is supported. Note, the 
                        index order isn't important.
                    </p>
                    <div class="container">
                        <strong>Example:</strong>
                        <pre class="code"> 1. This is a High priority list item.
 1. This is a High priority list item. 
 2. This is a Normal priority list item. 
 1. This is a High priority list item. 
 2. This is a Normal priority list item.
 3. This is a Minor priority list item.
 3. This is a Minor priority list item. 
                        </pre>
                        <div class="result"></div>

                    </div> 

                    <h3>Category</h3>
                    <p>
                        When creating creating items it's useful to be able to assign a Category to an item. These Categories are 
                        fixed to the following types - New, Fix, Changed and Developer (where Developer describes a change that 
                        developers would be interested over users).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Markdown doesn't have an exact way of expressing this requirement, hence we use the following notation at 
                        the end of the item "+New".
                    </p>
                    <div class="container">
                        <strong>Examples:</strong>
                        <pre class="code"> - This is a New list item. +New
 - This is a Fix list item. +Fix
 - This is a Change list item. +Change
 - This is a New list item. +New
 - This is a Developer list item. +Developer

                    <h3>Release (Not Working)</h3>
                    <p>
                        In some cases we want to have the one document that describes many releases. In this case, the 
                        syntax simply allows you to define a heading which is the Version Number. If you use this feature 
                        in conjunction with sections, Section headers are also altered.
                    </p>

                        In the same way that we may want to have a document that contains many Releases, we may want 
                        to have a document that contains many Projects. In this case, the syntax simply allows you 
                        to define a heading which is the Project name. If you use this feature, it assumes that you 
                        will also provide the Release details (Version Numbers) for each release. When this is done,
                        Release and Section headers are also altered.
