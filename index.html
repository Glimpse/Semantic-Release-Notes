            <h1>Semantic Release Notes</h1>

            <p>
                Semantic Release Notes (SRN) is a text-to-object-to-html conversion tool for application authors. SRN 
                specificly aims to produce <em>typed</em> <strong>Release Notes</strong> from a <strong>Markdown</strong> document. 
                This allows authors to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text document, convert it to structured object 
                (typically JSON or XML) and from this object, convert it into any styled format (typically html) or to consume the 
                typed information within 3rd party applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thus, SRN is two things:
                <ol>
                    <li>a plain text formatting syntax; and</li>
                    <li>a software tool that converts plain text formatting to JSON/XML and HTML.</li>
                </ol>
                See the <a href="#Syntax">Syntax</a> section for details pertaining to SRN fomatting syntax. You can 
                also try it out, right now, using the online <a href="#Editor">Editor</a> or extending the provided 
                examples.  
            </p>
            
            <h3>Goals</h3>

            <p>
                The overriding design goals for SRN's formatting syntax is:
                <ul>
                    <li>to make it as <strong>readable as possible</strong>,</li>
                    <li>to make this document <strong>parsable by a standard Markdown parser</strong>, and</li>
                    <li>to <strong>extract typed release information</strong> from the document.</li>
                </ul> 
                The idea is that a SRN-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, 
                without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. This works well in a 
                Release Notes senario where plan text documents usually accompany the build. Additional, with the 
                assumtptions around the formating of the Release document, SRN can <strong>extract semantic meaning</strong> 
                from the plain text provided (i.e. the bugs fixed, features, included, release summaries, etc).
            </p>

            <h3>Influences</h3>

            <p>
                The estabilishment of the overall snytax and simplicity of the document is based on <strong>Markdown</strong>.
                As stated, a document based on SRN's syntax should be able to be parsed by a standard Markdown parser. 
                This means that besides making the document human readable, it means that systems that aren't SRN 
                aware but are Markdown aware, can still parse the documents.
            </p>

            <p>
                The idea of being able to extract typed meaning from the document, isn't estabilished here, rather 
                influcences where drawn from the typed format of <strong>TODO.txt</strong> files. Documents that 
                follow the conventions of the TODO.txt "standard" are able to extract typed information within the 
                TODO domain from the document. The origins on the stanrd are similar to those of Markdown (a need 
                for human readability), but also a need to be able to define tasks, which are complete, what priority 
                a given task has, etc.
            </p>

            <h2>Basics</h2>
            
            <h3>The axes of an Semantic Release Notes </h3>

            <p>
                Using the Markdown syntax in a SRN, you can create a list that’s sliceable by various key axes.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Item</strong>:
                        A release note should be able to show which "items" are included in a given release. This is indicated via 
                        a standard Markdown <em>ordered</em> or <em>unorderded list</em>. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Section</strong>:
                        Lets the author group items which represent logical sections within the application. 
                        These can be abratary in nature and specifc to the release notes which application is for.
                        This is indicated via a standard Markdown <em>header</em>. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Release</strong>:
                        As SRN allows for many releases to be defined within the one block of text, the system needs 
                        to provide a means by which an indovidual release can be identified.
                        This is indicated via a standard Markdown <em>header</em>. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Project</strong>:
                        As SRN allows for many projects with many releases to be defined within the one block of 
                        text, the system needs to provide a means by which an indovidual release can be identified.
                        This is indicated via a standard Markdown <em>header</em>. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Priority</strong>:
                        The release note should be able to let you define the importance feature or item that has been 
                        defined. This is indicated via a standard Markdown <em>ordered list</em>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Category</strong>:
                        Additionally the release note should be able to indicate what category an item is. For instance, 
                        "+New", "+Change", "+Fix", +Developer". This is indicated via a single word at the end of the 
                        list item that has a "+" prefix. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p> 
            
            <h3>Summaries</h3>

            <p>
                It is useful to be able to provide summaries various parts of the release. Sections, Releases and Projects allow 
                for multi-line multi-paragraph summaries. The summary for an Item is more restictive only allowing a 
                single paragraph descriptions. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In each content block, a subset of Markdown is supported -  _italic_, **bold**, `code` and [link](uri).  
                <div class="container">
                    <strong>Item:</strong>
                    <pre class="code"> - This is the _first_ *list* item.
 - This is the **second** __list__ item.
 - This is the `third` list item.
 - This is the [forth](?) list item.</pre>
                    <div class="result"></div>
                    <pre class="object"></pre>
                </div> 
                <div class="container">
                    <strong>Sections, Releases and Projects:</strong>
                    <pre class="code"># Section
This is a _section_ with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor
sit amet consectetuer **adipiscing** elit. Aliquam hendrerit
mi posuere lectus.

Vestibulum `enim wisi` viverra nec fringilla in laoreet

                    <div class="result"></div>
                    <pre class="object"></pre>
                </div> 
            </p>

            <h3>Items</h3>
            
            <p>
                When trying to extract indovidual items that make up a release, standard lists (ordered or unordered) are used. These 
                lists indicate the items what are a part of the Section or Release they are a part of.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since the syntax is a subset of Markdown the same list types are supported.  
                <div class="container">
                    <strong>Release and Section Items:</strong>
                    <pre class="code"> - This is a Release scoped first list item.
 - This is a Release scoped second list item.
                        
# Section
 * This is a Section scoped first list item.
 * This is a Section scoped second list item.

# Other Section
 + This is a Section scoped first list item.
 + This is a Section scoped second list item.
                    </pre>
                    <div class="result"></div>
                    <pre class="object"></pre>
                </div> 
            </p>
